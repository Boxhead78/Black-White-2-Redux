// Description:    Fain wants you to make him be impresive by luring the Norse
//                Creature in to the town while he proclaims that he is in
//                control of it.

/**********************************************
*** Full Description
***********************************************
Fain is somewhere on the land, with a scroll above him.
If fain is hurt, the scroll disapears and he runs away and the challenge
    ends.
If the scroll is cliked on, fain explains that he needs the Norse creature
    to come to him while he's doing his pulpit. The player has no way to 
    refuse.
Fain will go over to his pulpit.
If he's hurt, he runs away and the challenge ends.
When fain arrives, he will start proclaiming his greatness.
As he does this, an audience begins to gather around him.
If fain is hurt while doing this, he and his audience run away and the
    challenge ends
If his audience is hurt, they run away for a little while, then come back.
    Fain will continue talking.
If the greek creature comes, his audience will laugh at him and fain will
    run back to his start position. His audience will disperse.
If the norse creature comes, his audience will celebrate and continue to
    watch fain as he goes on and on about his greatness. The success
    cut-scene happens, the player gets his reward, everyone disperses, and
    the challenge ends.
If fain finishes his speach but nothing happens, he will claim that he needs
    'more practice' and run off back to his start position. His audience
    will disperse.
If fain has gone back to his start possition, a scroll will apear above his
    head. This will then loop back to the begining.
If fain decides to go back to his start position a second time, he instead
    runs away and the challenge ends.
