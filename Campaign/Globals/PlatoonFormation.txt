//   Platoon Formation Script
//    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//
//    This script controls player platoon formations in different lands.
//    Platoons which have been placed by scripts need to be released first, else
//    the formation won't be applied by this script.
//    Below you can find some settings to edit.
//    This file needs constants.txt from the redux mod in order to compile correctly.
